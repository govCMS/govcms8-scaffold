# GovCMS8 SaaS Project Scaffolding

This is a composer project which builds a Drupal 8 GovCMS **SaaS** site ready for
hosting on the GovCMS platform (Lagoon). If you are a new GovCMS customer
looking this project on [Github](https://github.com/govCMS/govcms8-scaffold-paas)
you may wait for the GovCMS service desk to create your own project.

For testing GovCMS off the platfrom, we recommend that you use our PaaS scaffold
which has a more conventional Drupal 8 structure.
