# GovCMS8 SaaS Project Scaffolding

This is a composer project which builds a Drupal 8 GovCMS **SaaS** site ready for
hosting on the GovCMS platform (Lagoon).

**Note**: If you are a new GovCMS customer visiting this page on
[Github](https://github.com/govCMS/govcms8-scaffold)
you may prefer to wait for the GovCMS service desk to create your project in Gitlab.

For testing GovCMS separately to the GovCMS platform, we recommend that you try
our [PaaS scaffold](https://github.com/govCMS/govcms8-scaffold-paas)
which has a more conventional Drupal 8 structure.
