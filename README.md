# GovCMS8 Project Scaffolding

This is a composer project which builds a Drupal 8 GovCMS site ready for
hosting on the GovCMS platform (Lagoon). If you are a new GovCMS customer
looking this project on [Github](https://github.com/govCMS/govcms8-scaffold-paas)
you may wait for the GovCMS service desk to create your own project.

For testing you can create a new project by running:

```
composer create-project govcms/govcms8-scaffold-paas MY_PROJECT
```
