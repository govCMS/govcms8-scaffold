# GovCMS8 SaaS Project Scaffolding

This is a composer project which builds a Drupal 8 GovCMS **SaaS** site ready for
hosting on the GovCMS platform (Lagoon).

**Note**: If you are a new GovCMS customer visiting this page on
[Github](https://github.com/govCMS/govcms8-scaffold-paas)
you may prefer to wait for the GovCMS service desk to create your project in Gitlab.

For testing GovCMS off the platfrom, we recommend that you try our PaaS scaffold
which has a more conventional Drupal 8 structure.
